The platform is designed to float for a long distance along a river, with passive stabilisation applied to maintain balance and directional stability during its journey. The primary river-related variables to be measured are depth of the waterbed, river surface current speed, the temperature of the river water and the air near the water surface. Additionally, the platform will collect and transmit the platform’s position (measured by a GPS module), the platform’s orientation, acceleration and angular velocity (using IMU). Data will be transmitted intermittently via the cellular network to provide real-time updates of the platform location and operational status. The sensor platform will also be equipped with a solar panel and rechargeable battery to ensure a sustainable power supply during extended deployments.
